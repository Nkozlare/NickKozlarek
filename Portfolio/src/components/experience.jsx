On the technical side, I built and repaired furniture and buildings, recognizing problems and fixing malfunctioning plumbing and electric components to last for years of hard use while managing and delegating the 50+ workers working on the farm. The most important work I did however, was integrating therapy with instrument and voice lessons to help the kids process what brought them to the children's home in the first place."
