This is the culmination of eight engineers working closely over the course of one week to complete an MVP based on client's request. I was the lead UI designer and built out most of the front end for this entire project. The front end was built using React and Javascript while the backend and server utilized PostgreSQL and Node.js. The live chat implemented Socket.io and google translate for live translation.

Our engineering team of four worked on four seperate components on the site: Product Overview, Related Products/Outfit, Questions & Answers, and Ratings & Reviews. The first phase of our development was acclimating to project management tools we had not previously used in depth, such as the Git Feature Branch Workflow and Trello. We used an agile scrum methodology and held two daily standups to keep track of each member's progress on the sub-components of the product as well as rotated group leader each sprint. The strengths of this product are a functional and intuitive user experience as well as its sleek and consistent design. Our team challenged ourselves by learning new technologies, including styled-components, React Hooks, and Jest testing."

Our team was tasked with recreating the database, building a fully functional RESTful API and deploying it using AWS. We were given multiple CSV files with 15+ million data entries and had to import the data, transform the resulting data using queries, optimize our queries, and eventually deploy the API to AWS. I was able to stress test the API using Loader.io and it performed very well, being able to withstand over two thousand requests every seconds. During this project we got more experience with Postgres, PGAdmin, AWS, git workflow, nginx, and Loader.io. Click the project title or Github icon to be brought to the Github repo."
